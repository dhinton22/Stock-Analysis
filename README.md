# Stock-Analysis

##Overview Of Project
Steve wants to do more research for his parents and find the best stock option to invest their retirement funds. In the initial analysis for one stock 'DQ' we determined that the company had a -63% return in 2018. This does not appear to be a safe option to invest. As a result, I expanded the datase to include the entire stock marker over the last few years.   The challenge in this projects is to refactor the intial code run only for stock 'DQ' to run for the entire stock market. 

###Results

 From my analysis, I determined that in 2017 all stocks received a 5% or higher return. However, in 2018 all stocks fell into a negative return of -3.5% or less. There are only two stocks that remained in a positive return for both 2017 and 2018, ENPH and RUN. However, 'ENPH' saw a decrease in return by 48% from 2017 to 2018 while 'RUN' saw an increase in return by 79%.
